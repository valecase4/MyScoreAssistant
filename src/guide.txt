How to Log In
Follow these steps to log in to MyScoreAssistant:

1. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):

Log in to your Google account.
Go to Security Settings.
Under "Signing in to Google", find and click on "2-Step Verification".
Follow the prompts to activate two-factor authentication. You may need to provide a phone number for SMS verification or set up an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator).

2. Search for the "App Passwords" Setting:

After enabling 2FA, stay on the Security Settings page.
If the "App Passwords" option is not visible:
In the search bar at the top of the Security Settings page, type "App Passwords" and press Enter.
Click on the "App Passwords" link that appears in the search results.

3. Generate an App Password:

If prompted, re-enter your Google account password.
Select "Mail" as the application and "Other (Custom)" for the device.
Name it "MyScoreAssistant" or anything similar.
Click Generate, and Google will provide a 16-character password. Copy this password for use in the MyScoreAssistant application.

4. Enable IMAP Access:

Go to Gmail Settings > See all settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP.
Under IMAP Access, ensure IMAP is enabled so the app can access your emails.

5. Enter Your Credentials:

In the MyScoreAssistant login screen:
Enter your university email address.
Paste the App Password generated in Step 3 into the password field.

6. Start the Application:

After entering your credentials, click Log In.

Why Enable Two-Factor Authentication and Use an App Password?
Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your Google account by requiring 
a second verification step (e.g., a code sent to your phone). To safely allow third-party applications 
like MyScoreAssistant to access your email, Google requires you to generate a unique App Password. 
This ensures that your primary account credentials are kept private.
